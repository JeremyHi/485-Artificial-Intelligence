(x, y) = (col, row)

=== action ===
The action used to transition from the parent to this node.

- The action's value will be a string "U", "D", "L", "R" otherwise

=== parent ===
The parent of this node in the search tree.
- The parent's value is None if the initial state
- The parent's value is a reference to the parent node otherwise

=== children ===
